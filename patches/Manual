JQR Mininova Noise/Drone Sounds

Inspired by drone machines such Grendel Drone Commander, Casper Drone Lab V2 & Analogue Solutions Vostok Matrixsynth and following the same musical philosophy, the Mininova become an auto-generative drone and noise structure.

Turn the Latch button on, play a note or a chord and let the sound evolve in time.
Every controller is programmed to give a fully performance experience, leaving you the power to modify almost every sound variation.

To better understand which parameters are affected from the Tweak Controls and the Animate Pads, please read the following notes and check the patches with the Mininova editor.
Feel free to modify and re-patch everything, in order to create your own drone machine!

Be aware that due to the extensive use of LFOs, the Tempo potentiometer become an essential tool to control the expression of every patch. As a starting point, please set the Tempo at 90 Bpm.

Be also aware that those patches are very noisy and loud, so turn the Master Volume down to 0 before try any of them! With the minimum volume play a note in Latch mode and slowly increase the Master Volume.
Some Animate Pads will increase the general volume due to distortions, it's a deliberate dynamic effect so DO NOT TRY ANY PATCH WEARING HEADPHONES!

.In/back

In order to this patch to work, you must physically connect the Left output to the External Input using a normal Jack cable (TS or TRS).
Turn the Master Volume to 0 and the Audio Input Gain to +10 (Menu > Audio In > InptGain)
Now play a note in Latch mode and slowly increase the Master Volume. 
As soon as you'll hear the feedback growing, start to play with the Master Volume controller until you find a sound you like. Now let it grows even more and enjoy the total saturation.
